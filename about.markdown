# About Me

Hello, my name is Colin Hale-Brown, I’m a mechanical engineer based in Portland, Oregon. With a passion for making and tinkering, I thrive on challenging myself to develop innovative solutions. I am a creative and curious individual who enjoys exploring new ideas and pushing myself to learn new things. In highschool, FIRST Robotics inspired me to become an engineer. At Oregon Sate University I worked to challenge myself in and out of the classroom. Feel free to check out my portfolio and see what I have been exploring recently.

<!-- I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic team that values innovation and collaboration. -->
